	Lightweight manycore processors stand out for their high level of
	parallelism and energy efficiency. However, its architectural
	characteristics introduce several challenges in software development. One
	of the central difficulties is the limited amount of local memory that the
	applications have available to work. This limitation needs to be considered
	by software solutions for \lws. In this context, this work proposes the
	definition of a task mechanism within an asymmetric microkernel designed
	for \lws. This mechanism makes it possible to define multiple execution
	streams at a low cost to the memory system through the implementation of
	a limited number of special threads. The results showed that the proposed
	mechanism achieved similar performance to that of a dedicated thread to
	each task.
