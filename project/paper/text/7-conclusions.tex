\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

	Lightweight manycore processors are promising candidates for modern
	computer systems to reach the Exascale era. However, its distinctive
	architectural features require efforts to redesign and propose new solutions
	that extract maximum performance from these processors. The purpose of this
	work is to explore the reduction in the use of kernel memory and provide
	a service to improve and assist concurrent and/or asynchronous services within
	the \os. The results showed that the proposed mechanism achieved similar
	performance to that of a dedicated thread to each task. As future work, we
	intend to model the entire Nanvix communication system using tasks and apply
	well-known task ordering scheduling algorithms on the proposed mechanism.
