		\begin{itemize}
			\setlength\itemsep{5mm}
			\item \textbf{Memory management} influences all abstraction levels
			\item \textbf{OSes must be lightweight} to make the most memory
				available to the application
			\item \textbf{Asymmetric microkernel} alleviate cache coherence problems
		\end{itemize}

				\begin{itemize}
					\setlength\itemsep{4mm}
					\item \textbf{Memory utilization:} each new thread requires memory pages
					\item Data locality: shared-memory region competition and no
						hardware support for cache coherence
					\item Core utilization: asymmetric microkernel does not use master
						core between syscall resquests
					\item Asynchronous operations: \lws may not feature a DMA, thus,
						a thread must polling data into the NoC
					\item Periodic operations: receive external commands and data
						requires that a thread exists to request a communication check
				\end{itemize}
